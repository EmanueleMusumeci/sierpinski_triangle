# Sierpinski triangle
Small JavaScript program to generate a Sierpinski triangle. Currently only the "[chaos game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle#Chaos_game)" method has been implemented.

See [my personal blog](https://sites.google.com/view/emanuelemusumeci/blog?authuser=0) for the result.
